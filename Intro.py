# An error is a problem or issue in the code that prevents it from running correctly.

# When we write a faulty code the execution of program may stop due to the errors

# There can be some places where exceptions can be caused

# Errors are caused by wrong syntax 

# Exceptions are logic based where in syntax is right but logic is not right. ex - zero division 


# Examples of errors

# SyntaxError
# NameError
# TypeError
# FileNotFoundError
# IndentationError
# ZeroDivisionError

# if : SyntaxError

# print(a) NameError

# "2" + 2 TypeError

# if True: IndentationError

# 5/0 ZeroDivisionError
