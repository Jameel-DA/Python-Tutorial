# OOPS stands for Object Oriented Programming Language

# The principal of OOPs are Based on 4 pillars apart from class and Objects

# class
# object
# Abstraction
# Polymorephism
# Encapsulation
# inheritance

# Class - A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have. Think of it as a template. 

# Object - An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object, youâ€™re creating a specific example of the class with its own unique data.

# Abstraction - Abstraction means displaying essential information and hiding the details
# Example - Car will be accelerate but internal working of engine not exposed.

# Encapsulation - Wrapping up of the data into a single class is called Encapsulation
# Example - Car can have colors, break, engine and a lot of other method.
# 
# Polymorephism - the word Polymorephism means having many forms.
# same class method can work differently for different objects. 

# Inheritance - when a class derives from another class.
