"""Rules For Declaring Variable
1. python is a case sensitive language so small letters and capital letters are different

2. make sure to not use spaces while creating a variable one can underscore(_)
to separate the names wgile writing a variable.
 
3. A Variable name should never start with a number or special symbols.

~ A Python variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
~ A Python variable name cannot start with a number.
~ A Python variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
~ Variable in Python names are case-sensitive (name, Name, and NAME are three different variables).
~ The reserved words(keywords) in Python cannot be used to name the variable in Python.
